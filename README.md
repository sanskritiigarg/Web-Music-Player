# Web-Music-Player

## Project Overview

This is a simple clone of the **Spotify** homepage built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The project aims to replicate the front-end design of Spotify’s main landing page, focusing on layout, structure, and styling. It is a non-interactive project, meaning it doesn't include any JavaScript functionality — just static content for design practice.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** Designed to look good on various screen sizes.
- **CSS Styling:** Styled to closely resemble Spotify’s homepage.
- **Navigation Bar:** Includes links to hypothetical sections like Home, Search, and Library.
- **Main Page:** Displays featured playlists, albums, and songs, mimicking Spotify’s layout.
- **Music Playback Bar:** A static footer bar designed to resemble Spotify’s music player controls.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
